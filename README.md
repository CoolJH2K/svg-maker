# SVG Maker
## Description
Want to make your very own SVG image? That's where this handy tool comes in! Just use your terminal to answer a couple of questions, and a custom SVG logo will be made just for you!
### Why did I make this?
I wanted to make a simple and easy way for people to create a simple SVG image. Making SVG images using HTML is fun, but it can take quite a while to get the exact kind of SVG image you want.
### What problem does this solve?
This simplifies the creation of a simple SVG image. And who knows? Maybe after a while, those who find this helpful might want to try to step outside of their comfort zone and learn how they can create even more shapes!
### What did I learn?
I learned a lot about how Inquirer prompts work and how they work with the FS/promises module to make the prompts function properly. Learning about how SVG images are made was also very fun!
## Video Demonstration
## Installation
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). This comes with npm preinstalled.
2. Open the terminal and enter "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to istall Inquirer.
3. Once Inquirer is finished installing, enter "npm i fs" to install the File Stystem methods.
4. After Inquirer and FS are installed, type "node index.js" to start the application!
